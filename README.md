Project Selection - Gentrification in Harlem and the Lower East Side

Introduction: 
Gentrification refers to the process by which a historically poor area experiences an influx of upper-class or wealthy individuals, resulting in a significant change to the area's landscape through the rebuilding of homes and businesses. This is commonly frowned upon because it dramatically changes areas and forces natives out, removing a sense of culture and unique identity. With this project, we aim to showcase prominent examples of gentrification in certain NYC neighborhoods, while also honoring the historical backgrounds of each area.

We will be examining both Harlem and the Lower East Side, as they have gone through a major transformation over the past four decades. These neighborhoods were once a symbol of cultural resilience and creativity, currently they reflect the challenges gentrification places onto them.  

The goal of this project is to efficiently analyze and compare a handful of gentrified neighborhoods in New York City in order to identify patterns, trends, and consequences that inform both current and future urban planning strategies. 

Methods:
Our story map will include a detailed introduction, explaining the meaning of gentrification and providing a historical background of both Harlem and the Lower East Side.
Historical background will include demographics and cultural identities of both areas prior to gentrification-causing mechanisms. 

Research 
Our research will identify key events and policies coinciding with demographic, cultural, and economic change in both areas. We will use comparative analysis to identify similar patterns in both areas, helping us understand why these areas have been particularly vulnerable to gentrification. 

Important Decades
Harlem: 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s. 
Lower East Side: 1980s, 1990s, 2000’s,  2010s, 2020s. .
We will include a visualization of each neighborhood during each decade to demonstrate the gentrification progression and the drastic changes that come with that.

ArcGIS Storymap Completed
The conclusion will provide current reports on both areas, demonstrating how decades of gentrification have transformed both areas to their current states. We will describe the consequences of this gentrification for those historically residing in these areas.
