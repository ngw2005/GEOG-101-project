Project Selection - Gentrification in Harlem and the Lower East Side

Introduction: 
Gentrification refers to the process by which a historically poor area experiences an influx of upper-class or wealthy individuals, resulting in a significant change to the area's landscape through the rebuilding of homes and businesses. This is commonly frowned upon because it dramatically changes areas and forces natives out, removing a sense of culture and unique identity. With this project, we aim to showcase prominent examples of gentrification in certain NYC neighborhoods, while also honoring the historical backgrounds of each area.

We will be examining both Harlem and the Lower East Side, as they have gone through a major transformation over the past four decades. These neighborhoods were once a symbol of cultural resilience and creativity, currently they reflect the challenges gentrification places onto them.  

The goal of this project is to efficiently analyze and compare a handful of gentrified neighborhoods in New York City in order to identify patterns, trends, and consequences that inform both current and future urban planning strategies.
